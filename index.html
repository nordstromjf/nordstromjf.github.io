<P>Linfield College offers courses in quantitative reasoning for all students. One model for a quantitative reasoning course is to provide students with a single cohesive topic. Ideally, such a topic can pique the curiosity of students with wide ranging academic interests and limited mathematical background. This text is intended for use in such a course. Game theory is an excellent topic for a non-majors quantitative course as it develops mathematical models to understand human behavior in social, political, and economic settings. The variety of applications can appeal to a broad range of students. Additionally, students can learn mathematics through playing games, something many choose to do in their spare time!</P>

<P>This text includes an exploration of the ideas of game theory through the rich context of popular culture. It contains sections on applications of the concepts to popular culture. It suggests films, television shows, and novels with themes from game theory. The questions in each of these sections are intended to serve as essay prompts for writing assignments.</P><P>Students can work through the text independently or as a class. The questions throughout the text help students discover the key ideas themselves.<P>

<P> A <A HREF="GameThyText2.pdf">pdf version</A> of the text is free to download. Although the materials have been classroom-tested, the book version is still in a draft form. I welcome any feedback on the materials.</P> (Current version posted: May 25, 2016.)

<P>An instructor's guide is available to verified course instructors by sending me an email.</P>

<P> I am currently working on an online version of the text.</P>
